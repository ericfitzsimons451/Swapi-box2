## Background/About
#### This project was our first attempt at using asyncronous Javascript.  As the first project of the 3rd module at Turing School of Software and Design, this week-long task gave us a good overview of working with the fetch API as well as asynchronous Javascript and async-testing.  The project asked for more robust code using modular project architecture, prop-types, and a very DRY approach.

## Tech Stack
#### -ReactJS
